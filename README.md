## What is This?

YouTube embedded videos do not run the anti-ad blocker code.
This allows you to play any _non-age restricted_ video through an embedded player.

## How Do I Use This?

1. Open [./youtube.html](./youtube.html).
2. Supply an input as a video url or JSON playlist.
3. Star the repository and enjoy your video.
